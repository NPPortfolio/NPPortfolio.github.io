    <h1>NPPortfolio</h1>

    <h2>Note to Employers</h2>

    <p>
        After an absence from programming, I have been working on this portfolio part-time in 2021 while filling in the
        many gaps in my development experience, and intend it to be something that I can continue to add to as I go.
        Ideally this learning process could be done in a working environment, so if any opportunities come up as I
        continue with the portfolio it would be put on halt. If not then hopefully in the future it can show a more
        established ability to develop for employers.
    </p>

    <h2 style = 'color:red'>Code Quality</h2>

    <p>
        At the time of writing this, the sculpting app is the only project on the portfolio and has a lot of serious problems in terms of code quality
        and good practices. Some of these practices (like immutability) were forfeited for performance, but others 
        (testing, specifications, functional vs. OOP, proper abstract data type representation, etc.) were implemented hastily or non-existent.
        The future projects should have a much greater emphasis on these things, but I wanted to write this note here to say
        that this would be an incredibly high priority in working-environment code, and the sculpting app's state right now does not reflect that.
        It would be a good idea for me to go back and polish the project, but for now I would like to start fresh with some new,
        maybe smaller and better documented projects.
    </p>
